# sea - Series Elastic Actuator prototype

This is a series of very rough sketches of how SEA work and how to design one,
based on a cheap servo (or two).

## sea1.scad

Just a visualization (a poor one) of how the inner wheels work and how to attach an elastic loop.

## sea2.scad

Actual prototype (but I will call it version 2), with a place for a servo and two potentiometers.
